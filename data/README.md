# Data Directory

This directory is used for storing local data files during development and testing.

## Usage

- Store sample datasets here for local testing
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large data files from version control
- Keep data files organized by source or pipeline

## Notes

- For production, data should be stored in Delta Lake tables
- Never commit sensitive or large datasets to version control
